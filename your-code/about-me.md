Rui is a Portuguese guy hailing from Brussels, Belgium.

No serious experience with "data" using industry standard tools, but experience with patent data (millions and millions of registers) using Stata. Helped on economics papers using Fortran.
VBA-geek: most recent VBA project at work included automatising decision production for a regulatory authority (sing Excel to query data-cubes, Excel and VBA to treat data and VBA to generate word documents).

Coming to Ironhack stems from the need to update some knowledge with industry tools and nudging a bit my career.

I expect to learn mostly python for data analysis, but mostly I expect to have fun!

I am in regulatory industry of the banking sector. I don't want to move too much. Ideally I stay in the same industry, but with a job description more focused on data analysis. If that is not possible, I consider moving to a risk position in a bank which utilises latest tools/technology for data analytics.

I am very modest in my life goals. I hope to achieve being a 0+ in the world (meaning having a marginally positive impact in the world). If everyone did that, I think we would be much better. The equilibrium we find ourselves in, in which everyone attempts to over achieve everything has been depicted as positive for society, but I doubt of the economics of that. 

As career goals, I want to keep on having a rather stable job, but I want to have more fun.
